            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                AL Hind Education and Trust Charitable is a registered non-profit organization,
                established in <strong>2009</strong>, committed to uplifting poor, orphaned, and
                socially weaker section children through education, welfare, and community support.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our focus is on empowering the Muslim community by providing access to
                quality Islamic and modern education, skill development, and essential life support.

            <h3>Why We Exist</h3>
            <p>
                Poverty, lack of education, and social neglect continue to limit the future of
                thousands of children. We exist to break this cycle by offering structured,
                value-based education and essential support to those who need it most.
